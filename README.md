## Experiment Results

| Model             | F1 Score (macro) |
|-------------------|------------------|
| `wide_resnet50_2` | 0.41             |
| `dinov2`          | 0.38             |

P.S. This was just an initial experiment â€” with better tuning and more training time, the results could definitely improve.
